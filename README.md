## aws-rails-provisioner

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/aws-rails-provisioner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/aws-rails-provisioner)

A tool for defining and deploying containerized Ruby on Rails applications on AWS.

`aws-rails-provisioner` is a command line tool using your configurations defined in `aws-rails-provisioner.yml` file to generate [AWS CDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk) stacks on your behalf, provisioning required AWS resources for running your containerized Ruby on Rails applications on AWS (current supported platform: AWS Fargate) within a few commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the `aws-rails-provisioner` gem, you need to have:

* a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application with a Dockerfile
* install or update the [AWS CDK Toolkit] from npm (requires [Node.js â‰¥ 8.11.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download)):

  ```bash
  $ npm i -g aws-cdk
  ```
* docker daemon vailable for building images

### Install aws-rails-provisioner

`aws-rails-provisioner` gem is available from RubyGems, currently with [preview versions](https://rubygems.org/gems/aws-rails-provisioner).

```
gem install aws-rails-provisioner --pre
```

### Define aws-rails-provisioner.yml

`aws-rails-provisioner.yml` is a configuration file defining how `aws-rails-provisioner` bootstraps required AWS resources for your Ruby on Rails applications.

```
version: '0'

vpc:
  max_az: 2
  enable_dns: true
services:
  my_rails_foo:
    source_path: ./path/to/my_rails_foo # relative path from `aws-rails-provisioner.yml`
    fargate:
      desired_count: 3
      memory: 512
      cpu: 256
      envs:
        PORT: 80
        RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: true
      public: true
    db_cluster:
      engine: aurora-postgresql
      db_name: app_development
    scaling:
      max_capacity: 5
      on_cpu:
        target_util_percent: 80
        scale_in_cool_down: 300
      on_requests:
        requests_per_target: 1000
  my_another_rails:
    ...
```

See `./examples` for more `aws-rails-provisioner` examples (see `tiny.yml` for a minimal `aws-rails-provisioner.yml` configuration example). The full configuration options are documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsrailsprovisioner/api/).

### Build and Deploy

Once `aws-rails-provisioner.yml` is defined, run the build command. This will boostrap AWS CDK stacks and define all required AWS resources and connections in CDK code.

```
aws-rails-provisioner build
```

By default, it defines a VPC with public and private subnets, an Amazon RDS Database Cluster, an ECS cluster with AWS Fargate services containing application images. When building with `--with-cicd` option a CICD stack will be defined automatically (including a Rails data migration step).

```
aws-rails-provisioner build --with-cicd
```

After the build completes, run the deploy command to run CDK code that deploys all defined AWS resources:

```
aws-rails-provisioner deploy
```

Instead of deploying everything all at once, you can deploy stack by stack, application by application:

```
# only deploys the stack creates VPC and ECS cluster
aws-rails-provisioner deploy --init

# deploys fargate service and database cluster when defined
aws-rails-provisioner deploy --fargate

# deploy CICD stack
aws-rails-provisioner deploy --cicd

# deploy only :rails_foo application
aws-rails-provisioner deploy --fargate --service my_rails_foo
```

After the deployment completes, your applications are now running on AWS Fargate fronted with AWS Application LoadBalancer. You can view your website using the public IP address of the network interface's load balancer.

> Note: for applications with databases, rails db migration is needed; the CICD stack contains a migration phase by default, running DB migration commands insides private subnets, connected to the DB Cluster.

### CICD

When `--with-cicd` is enabled at build, a CICD stack is created. Once deployment completes, an AWS CodePipeline is available with source, build, migration, and deploy phases for your Rails application. You need to commit your Rails application to the CodeCommit source repository in the pipeline with `buildspec` files to activate the pipeline. Sample `buildspec`s are availble under `./buildspecs` handling application image builds and rails migrations.

Full `aws-rails-provisioner` command line options see:

```
aws-rails-provisioner -h
```
